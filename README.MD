## ATARI 7800/2600 Conversion & Development

### Translation of 7800 games
Converted code that can be fully compiled using Atari Dev Studio and the DASM compiler:
- DIGDUG_DASM: The classic DIGDUG game fully restored.
- GALAGA_STANDARD_DASM: The standard version of GALAGA ported using DASM.
- GALAGA_ENHANCED_DASM: The enhanced higher graphics version of GALAGA ported using DASM.
- MSPACMAN: The classic MS. PACMAN game fully restored.
- PACMAN: A romhack of MS. PACMAN into the classic PACMAN.

The games in Unfinished_Games_DASM are yet to be ported and compiled.

### Tutorials
This includes small projects and examples drawn from other sources that we explored to learn more about the Atari 2600 and its assembly code.
- HelloWorld: A simple 2600 application that displays text, great for mastering on screen writing and hexadecimal code.
- Ball: A classic 2600 football game enhanced with smoother animation, great for mastering frames and animation.
- Snake: An exploration of a basic snake game, great for learning dynamic sprites and score keeping. This isn't for any Atari console; it runs in a special 6502 emulator: http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502
- Collect: A basic 2600 game inspired by a blogpost; the player must go around the play area and collect as many boxes as possible within the time limit.
