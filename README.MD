## ATARI 7800/2600 Conversion & Development

### Translation
Converted code that can be fully compiled using Atari Dev Studio and the DASM compiler:
- DIGDUG_DASM: The classic DIGDUG game fully restored.
- GALAGA_STANDARD_DASM: The standard version of GALAGA ported using DASM.
- GALAGA_ENHANCED_DASM: The enhanced higher graphics version of GALAGA ported using DASM.

The games in Unfinished_Games_DASM are yet to be ported and compiled.

### Tutorials
This includes small projects and examples that we explored to learn more about the chipset and its assembly functioning.
- HelloWorld: A simple application that displays text, great for mastering on screen writing and hexadecimal code.
- Ball: A classic football game enhanced with smoother animation, great for mastering frames and animation.
- Snake: An exploration of a basic snake game, great for learning dynamic sprites and score keeping.
- Collect: A basic game inspired by a blogpost, the player must go around the play area and collect as many boxes as possible within the time limit.
